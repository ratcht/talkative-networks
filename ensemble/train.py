"""
Train an ensemble over frozen backbones, given a split and backbone checkpoints.

Methods (one subcommand each; gating will join later):

communicative — TarMAC-aligned ensemble: per-specialist Q/K/V heads, bare
                attention bus, decoder injection via hooks.

A `summarize` subcommand aggregates a group of same-config, different-seed
replicate runs (produced by scripts/replicate_joint.py) into one summary run.

Example
-------
uv run python ensemble/train.py communicative \\
    --manifest selection/manifests/high_gap.json \\
    --split-file splits/three_way_seed42.pt \\
    --epochs 10 --k-rounds 1
